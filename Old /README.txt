1. OVERVIEW

The file "run_analysis.R" pulls data from the data set,
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones," as linked
to in the Coursera course page, and performs some simple
operations to clean and summarize the data.


2. INPUTS

X_test.txt: Raw observations from the "test" dataset.
y_test.txt: Activity ID for the data above
X_train.txt: Raw observations from the "train" dataset.
y_train.txt: Activity ID for the data above

features.txt: List of variables that were measured
activity_labels.txt: mapping from Activity ID to Activity name.


3. SCRIPT LOGIC

The script performs the following actions to clean and 
summarize the data:

- Merges "test" and "train" datasets
- Appends activity IDs and activity names
- Labels variable names by observation type (features.txt)
- Extracts only variables that represent a mean or standard
  deviation
- Caclulates an average for the above variables grouped by 
  the six activity types


4. OUTPUT

GetData_W3.txt: A text file containing the output of a data
frame generated by the "run-analysis.R" script.

Row labels: 6 types of activities tracked in the experiment
Column labels: All variables in the experiment associated with
		a mean or standard deviation
Values: The means of the variables grouped by activity
